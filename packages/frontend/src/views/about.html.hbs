          The Sustainability Cooperative was conceptualized in the fall of 2018 as a by-product of multiple project-based student organizations seeking one anotherâ€™s expertise. After two lengthy meetings held in LEAFHouse that fall, several students, faculty and staff decided it resoundingly beneficial to join forces and act as one sustainable body with many moving parts. The following spring semester, we began meeting monthly in person and weekly via Google Hangouts. Members of the Maryland Food Cooperative educated those in attendance about the requirements to act as a true cooperative, and the name SCoop was born!
